# 🤖 Task 1: Extractive Summarizer

This project implements an **extractive summarization technique** to generate concise summaries from longer documents. The tool automatically selects the most informative sentences based on **TF-IDF scores** and combines them into a coherent summary.

---

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- 📓 **Jupyter Notebook** – Interactive coding environment for examples and testing  
- 🐍 **Python** – Core programming language  
- 🧠 **Scikit-learn** – TF-IDF vectorization and sentence ranking  
- 🧹 **NLTK** – Sentence tokenization  
- 📊 **Pandas / NumPy** – Data handling and manipulation  
- 📈 **Matplotlib** – Visualizing sentence importance

# 🧠 Task 3: AI-Powered Knowledge Updater

This project is a smart and efficient **Knowledge Updater chatbot** that allows users to:

- 🔍 Ask questions on general topics  
- 🧠 Get answers from a **locally stored knowledge base (ChromaDB)**  
- 💬 Automatically fallback to **Google Gemini API** if no match is found  
- 📚 Easily **add new knowledge** by topic (from Wikipedia)

The entire system is built with an interactive **Streamlit** UI, and it continuously enhances its ability to answer questions over time.
